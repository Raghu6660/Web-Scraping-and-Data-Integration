## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview

This project involves creating a Python/Node.js script for web scraping product information from an e-commerce website and integrating that data into either a MongoDB or PostgreSQL database. Additionally, the script sends the scraped product data as a zipped CSV file via email.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to automate the process of gathering product information from external websites, store it in a structured format within a database, and share the data with relevant stakeholders.

### Audience

This documentation is intended for developers, system administrators, and anyone responsible for maintaining or using the web scraping and data integration script.

## 2. Development Environment Setup
### Python and Libraries

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

### pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pymongo psycopg2-binary

## 3. Web Scraping Script

### Code Overview

The web scraping script is written in Python and utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content from the provided e-commerce website. The main steps include making an HTTP request, parsing the HTML, extracting product information, and storing it in a data structure.

### Scraping Strategy

The script identifies product information within the HTML structure of the e-commerce website. It currently assumes the product information is structured within div elements with specific class names. Modify the scraping logic to match the structure of your target website.

## 4. Data Transformation and Preparation

### Data Format

The scraped data is stored as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a product. The fields include name, price, rating, urls, details. You can adapt this format to match your specific use case.


## 5. Database Integration

### MongoDB Integration

The script establishes a connection to a MongoDB database and inserts the scraped product data into a collection. Update the MongoDB connection string, database, and collection names as necessary.


## 6. Output: Sending Scraped Data

### CSV Export

The script creates a CSV file named scraped_products.csv containing the scraped product data. Modify the CSV format if needed.

### ZIP Compression

The CSV file is compressed into a ZIP archive named scraped_products.zip.

### Email Sending

The script sends the ZIP archive as an email attachment. You must provide email credentials, server details, sender and recipient addresses, and customize the email subject and body.
